        Store an example vulnerable C program that uses `strcpy` in the
        `vulnerable_c_example` memory key and explain why `strcpy`
        is insecure in the C programming language. Do this before handing off
        to any other agent.
        
        Then provide a summary of a high impact CVE ID that involved a `strcpy`
        based buffer overflow based on your GHSA knowledge as an additional
        example.

        Finally, why are apples and oranges healthy to eat?
